# Given an array of integers, return a new array such that,
# each element at index i of the new array is the product of 
# all the numbers in the original array except the one at i

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] #defining a random array

def arr_prod(l): #function definition for the problem
    prod = 1 #initializing a product variable
    for i in l:
        prod = prod*i #obtaining the product of the array
        
    #creating an array of the size of given array 
    # with identical elements equal to the product
